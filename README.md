# MicroStrategy Web SDK Samples
This is a collection of samples highlighting MicroStrategy Web customizations and the use of the Java API in stand-alone java examples.

## Structure
Samples are currently organised into two categories:
- [Plugins](./plugins)
  - These are intended for deployment in MicroStrategy Web environments.
- [Stand-alone code](./stand-alone/)
  - These can be added as a "src" folder in Eclipse.
  - These can be executed in any Java environment that has the MicroStrategy Web Java libraries within the class path, and can communciate with the MicroStrategy Intelligence Server machine.

## Disclaimer
These samples are executable proof-of-concept demonstrations of specific functionality found within the MicroStrategy Web SDK, and do not necessarily demonstrate best practices for production use.
